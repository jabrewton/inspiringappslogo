Complete the logo challenge


CHALLENGE SPECS
The logo should begin in this state:
• There should be a Reset button to return the logo to its starting state at any time.
• A user should be able to drag a dot from its starting position to the appropriate location in
the logo.
• Dots dropped in the wrong location should be rejected.
• Two dots cannot occupy the same space.
• The finished logo should include the dots in the appropriate location within the logo.
• When the logo is properly assembled, congratulate the user.
• The tool should function in a desktop browser.
• Implement the tool first by using a separate DOM element for each image. 

For bonus points, but not required, feel free to include in the project any additions where
you shine as a developer. We are always encouraged to see what a person feels is
important when working on projects like this.
